                Hello I am Vladimir, an aspiring web designer. I was born in Nicaragua and I
                have been living in San Francisco since I was five years old. I love to travel and I enjoy being out
                doors.
                When I was in high school I enjoyed running and competing in cross-country and track and field. My
                personal
                best times were 1:58 for the 800 meters, 4:18 for the mile and 16:30 for 5000 meters. My sophomore year
                I qualified
                and competed at the Junior Olympics and my junior year of high school I won the San Francisco
                cross-country Championship.
            </p>
            <p class="firstletter maininfo textleft">
                After high school I had to give up my dream of becoming a professional athlete because I needed to
                support myself.
                So I decided to get training to develop the skills needed to work on engines. Since I was a kid I was
                always facinated about how engines work.
                After a couple of years of training I found myself working as a professional Diesel Technician who
                worked on several different types of systems
                including hydralic, natural gas, propane, compression release engine brakes and much more. My specialty
                was working on Cummins Diesel Engines.
                My responsibilities where to diagnose and repair heavy duty engines that were in trucks, construction
                equipment, boats, and generators.
            </p>
            <p class="firstletter maininfo textleft">
                After several years in the field I decided to hang up the wrenches and try something new again, so I
                went back to school
                and started working towards a bachelor degree but got distracted with web technologies. So here I am
                trying to understand everything
                about the web. Currently I have experience in HTML, CSS and javaScript. Iâ€™m excited to bring my life
                experience to the process of building
                fantastic looking websites. I am a life long learner who is always interested in expanding my skills
                with a great attitude.
