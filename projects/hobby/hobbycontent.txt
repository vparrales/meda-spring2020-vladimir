A little bit about me

Hello! My name is Vladimir and I live in San Francisco California. What if everyday was and adventure? If that question sparks any wonder of possibilities, well let one of those possibilities be travel. Travel is fun! It makes your life more rich and full of experiences. I enjoy doing it because I learn a lot about geography, politics, people, cultures, nature and food. Not only is learning part of the experience and adventure, but you also experience different flavors of food and get to have friends all over the world! You are exposed to all sorts of environments
and sometimes you will feel completely out of place, but don't worry its really fun! You feel alive, present and have that kid wonder in you. Aside from all, traveling around the world alone helps develope interdisciplinary skills. And to top it all off, traveling gives the opportunity and possibility of networking around the world!

Tips on Travel
Here are a few guidelines on how to travel safely and cheaply. The first thing to do is a lot of research. Research the country and region that you will visit. Consider the weather. Make sure you check the weather before you go. Don't show up packed with summer clothes and its snowing. Itâ€™s good to know how the weather is going to be. If you decide to travel extensively for months try to go to places with similar climates. I personally prefer warm and hot climates. It is also a good idea to travel light. Preferably a backpack that you can carry on the plane. I traveled around the world with a 5kg (approx. 11 lbs.) backpack. Another important thing to bring on your trip is a smartphone. Technology today makes traveling much easier. Make sure that your smartphone is unlocked or jailbroken otherwise it probably won't work in different parts of the world. Download the following apps and create accounts to have options while traveling! I suggest setting up your accounts in advance before leaving on the trip.
