        <h1>Everyday is an Adventure here!</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Vladimir and I live here in San Francisco. What if everyday was and adventure? If that question makes you
            wonder of possibilities, well one of those for me is travel. Travel is fun! It makes your life more rich and full of experiences. 
            I enjoy doing it because I learn a lot
            about Geography, Politics, people, cultures, nature and food. Not only is learning part of the adventure, but you experience different
            flavors of food and get to have friends all over the world! You are exposed to all sorts of environments and sometimes you will feel
            completely out of place, but don't worry its really fun. You feel alive, present and have that kid wonder in you. 
            Aside from all, traveling around the world alone helps develope interdiciplinary 
            skills. On top of all that, traveling gives the opportunity and possibility of networking around the world!
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few guide lines on how to travel safely and cheaply. So the first thing to do is a lot of really good research. Research
           the country and region that you will visit. Consider the weather. Make sure you check the weather before you go. Don't show up
            packed with summer clothes and its snowing. Its good to know how the weather is going to be. 
            If you decide to travel extensively for months try to go to places with similiar climates. I personaly 
            prefer warm and hot climates. It is also a good idea to travel light. Preferrably a backpack that you can carry on. 
            I traveled around the world with a 5kg (approx 11 lbs) backpack. Another important thing to bring on your trip is 
            a smartphone. Technology today makes traveling much easier. Make sure that your smartphone is unlocked or jaibroken. 
            Download these apps and create accounts so you cam make traveling fun! I suggest setting up your accounts in advance before
            leaving on the trip.

            interdTo some degree this is a form of networking. I am here to talk about how to travel around the world. Traveling is fun!
            If 
            I took my first trip around the world in 2019. Up until now it was the best time of my
            life! If you have the opportunity to travel and explore different countries around the world, 
            I say take the opportunity</p>

        <p>Another important thing to bting along is an international driving permit. Having it will allow driving different types of motor
            vehicles like cars, bikes and scooters. You can pick up an international driving permit at a  AAA office. You will have to fill
            out an application and provide two passport photos. Passport photos can be taken at Walgreens. Take a look at the following article
