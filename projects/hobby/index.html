            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-style">Hello! My name is Vladimir and I live in San Francisco California. What if every day 
                was and adventure? If that question sparks any wonder of possibilities, we’ll let one of those possibilities 
                be travel. Traveling is fun! It makes your life richer and fuller of experiences. I enjoy doing it because I 
                learn a lot about geography, politics, people, cultures, nature and food. Not only is learning part of the 
                experience and adventure, but you also experience different flavors of food and get to have friends all over 
                the world! You are exposed to all sorts of environments and sometimes you will feel completely out of place, 
                but don't worry its really fun! You feel alive, present and have that kid wonder in you. Aside from all, traveling 
                around the world alone helps develop interdisciplinary skills. And to top it all off, traveling gives the opportunity 
                and possibility of networking around the world!

            <h2>Tips on Travel</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-style">Here are a few guide lines on how to travel safely and cheaply. The first thing to 
                do is a lot of research. Research the country and region that you will visit. Consider the weather. Make sure 
                you check the weather before you go. Don't show up packed with summer clothes and its snowing. Its good to know 
                how the weather is going to be. If you decide to travel extensively for months try to go to places with similar 
                climates. I personally prefer warm and hot climates. It is also a good idea to travel light. Preferably a backpack 
                that you can carry on the plane. I traveled around the world with a 5kg (approx. 11 lbs.) backpack. Another important 
                thing to bring on your trip is a smartphone. Technology today makes traveling much easier. Do you guys remember the days 
                when we were using maps? Make sure that your smartphone is unlocked or jailbroken otherwise it probably won't work in 
                different parts of the world. Download the following apps and create accounts to have options while traveling! I suggest 
                setting up your accounts in advance before leaving on the trip.</p>

            <h2>Additional Tips and Other Online Resources</h2>

            <p class="paragraph-style">Another important thing to bring along is an international driving permit. Having
                it will allow driving different types of motor vehicles like cars, bikes and scooters. You can pick up
                an
                international driving permit at a AAA office. You will have to fill out an application and provide two
                passport
                photos. Passport photos can be taken at Walgreens. Take a look at the following article it is a great
                read that
